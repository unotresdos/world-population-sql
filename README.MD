# World Populations SQL Practice

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals
You’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. You’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

## Project Execution

 1. What years are covered by the dataset?
 2. What is the largest population size for `Gabon` in this dataset?
 3. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?
 4. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?
 5.  How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?
 6. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in `Indonesia`?
